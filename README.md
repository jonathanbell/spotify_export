# Spotify Export

A small program to export your Spotify library to a JSON file format.

## Usage

THe simplest way to use the program/script is to download [a release binary](https://github.com/jonathanbell/spotify_export/releases) for your system and double-click it. A browser will open and ask you to authorize the program in Spotify. The exported JSON file will be on your desktop after the export has finished.

## TODOs

- [ ] Setup our own Spotify client_id
